## status: accepted.

## Context and Problem Statement

We are currently working on a web development project and need to make a decision regarding the CSS framework to be
used. The project aims to deliver a user-friendly, responsive, and visually appealing web application. After evaluating
various options, we are considering adopting Tailwind CSS as the primary framework for styling and layout.

## Decision Considerations

- Improved Developer Efficiency
- Consistent and Responsive Design
- Learning Curve

## Considered Options

- Hootsuite
- Sprout Social
- G2 Deals

## Decision Outcome

After evaluating the above options based on our decision considerations, we have decided to adopt Tailwind CSS as the
CSS framework for our project.

## Consequences

### Positive

Improved Developer Efficiency:
Tailwind CSS provides a utility-first approach, offering an extensive set of pre-defined classes that can be directly
applied to HTML elements. This approach eliminates the need to write custom CSS, resulting in faster development and
reducing the overall codebase.
The intuitive class naming conventions and comprehensive documentation of Tailwind CSS make it easier for developers to
understand and leverage the framework's capabilities efficiently.

Consistent and Responsive Design:
Tailwind CSS provides responsive utilities out of the box, enabling us to build responsive layouts without writing
custom media queries. This feature saves development time and ensures a consistent user experience across different
devices and screen sizes.
The framework's consistent design patterns and utility classes facilitate maintaining a cohesive visual style throughout
the application, promoting code reusability and reducing the chances of inconsistencies.

### Negative

Learning Curve:
Adopting Tailwind CSS may require developers to familiarize themselves with its unique class-based approach and
utility-first philosophy. While this might initially involve a learning curve, the comprehensive documentation and
active community support can mitigate any challenges and facilitate the transition effectively.

## Conclusion

After considering the decision factors and evaluating the available options, we have decided to adopt Tailwind CSS as
the CSS framework for our project. Tailwind CSS offers improved developer efficiency and consistent and responsive
design. Although there might be a learning curve associated with adopting Tailwind CSS, the available resources and
community support will help our team in quickly adapting to the framework.
