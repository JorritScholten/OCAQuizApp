## git Workflow

1. Create new Todo item in Project board.
2. Write description of item so that the DoD (Definition of Done) is defined.
3. Click on `Convert to Issue`
4. Open the issue in the git repository.
5. Click on `Create a branch`
6. In the editor perform a `git pull` and **checkout the newly created branch**.
7. Perform the necesary work and commit changes made with comments describing what is done (description can be very minimal).
8. Don't forget to push commits semi-regularly.
9. When the work meets the DoD, ensure all changes have been commited and pushed, then on GitHub click on `Compare & Pull Request` to create a pull request that the rest of the team can then evaluate.
